## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

It's basically the same as my first challenge so there isn't a lot to learn. But, if you want to make text background to fit its text, then use `max-content`.
### Continued development

I want to tackle a more difficult challenge to hone my skill even further.
